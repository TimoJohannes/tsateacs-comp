# idea

- digital sample and hold eurorack module
- nice adc and dac
- feed it cv and clock and it will spit out that sequence at the same or different clocks
- steve reich inspired fading will ensue

# hardware

- stm? atmega?
- cv out maybe like [mi yarns](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/yarns) or [o_C](https://ornament-and-cri.me/) or [stages](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/stages). For stages there are some nice [calibration notes](https://github.com/forestcaver/MIStagesStuff/blob/master/__CalibrationNotes.txt)
- cv in could be like o_C
- per channel:
  - one encoder with button
  - one 7 segment
  - cv in 
  - cv out
  - clock in
