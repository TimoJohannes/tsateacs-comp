+ idea

- digital sample and hold eurorack module
- nice adc and dac
- feed it cv and clock and it will spit out that sequence at the same or different clocks
- steve reich inspired fading will ensue

+ hardware

- stm? atmega?
- cv out maybe like (mi yarns)[https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/yarns] or [o_C][https://ornament-and-cri.me/]
- cv in could be like o_C
- per channel:
  - one encoder with button
  - one 7 segment
  - cv in 
  - cv out
  - clock in
