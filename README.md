## Abstract

Spicerack_001: Cvrry

> "I discovered that the most interesting music of all was made by simply lining the loops in unison, and letting them slowly shift out of phase with other."
-Steve Reich

Cvrry, the first module in a range called Spice Rack, is a digital supporting module for sequencers. It takes control voltage signals, samples them with the help of a clock signal, and allows the user to replay the signals at different divisions or multiplications of the original clock. It open possibilites for phasing or polyphony in small systems that would not usally allow it. Musical phrases drift apart, and come closer again, synchronising and clashing.
